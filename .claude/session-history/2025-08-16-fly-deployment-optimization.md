## Files Modified in This Session
```
compose.override.yaml - Removed version attribute
compose.yaml - Removed version attribute
fly.toml - Complete rewrite to match webchessclock configuration
server/lib/redis-client.js - Replaced with webchessclock's advanced RedisClient
server/api/health.js - Added from webchessclock
Dockerfile - Added NUXT_HOST and NUXT_PORT environment variables
```

## Current Branch
```
master
```

## Overview
Applied webchessclock's containerization and deployment optimization strategies to shogiwebroom. The goal was to create a consistent, cost-optimized deployment setup across both projects while ensuring proper Redis connectivity and health monitoring.

## Changes Made

### 1. Redis Connection Fix
- **Problem**: shogiwebroom was using basic ioredis connection that couldn't handle Upstash REST API
- **Solution**: Copied webchessclock's advanced RedisClient with Upstash HTTPS support and memory fallback
- **Result**: Proper Redis connectivity with automatic fallback for high availability

### 2. Environment Variable Configuration
- **Problem**: Missing NUXT_HOST and NUXT_PORT causing 503 errors (app not accessible externally)
- **Solution**: Added proper environment variables in both fly.toml and Dockerfile
- **Configuration**:
  - `NUXT_HOST = "0.0.0.0"` (external access)
  - `NUXT_PORT = "3000"` (explicit port binding)

### 3. Fly.toml Standardization
- **Problem**: shogiwebroom had inconsistent, overcomplicated fly.toml with unnecessary settings
- **Solution**: Replaced with exact copy of webchessclock's proven configuration
- **Key Settings**:
  - `auto_stop_machines = true` (cost optimization)
  - `memory_mb = 256` (minimal resource usage)
  - `interval = "30s"` (health check frequency)
  - Removed unnecessary concurrency, services, and restart sections

### 4. Health Check API Integration
- **Problem**: shogiwebroom lacked proper health monitoring
- **Solution**: Added webchessclock's comprehensive health check API
- **Features**: Redis status, memory usage, uptime tracking

### 5. Docker Configuration Cleanup
- **Problem**: Docker Compose had deprecated version attributes causing warnings
- **Solution**: Removed version attributes from both compose.yaml and compose.override.yaml

## Technical Details

### Redis Implementation
- **Advanced Client**: Supports both Upstash HTTPS REST API and standard Redis
- **Automatic Fallback**: Switches to in-memory storage if Redis fails
- **Security**: Proper token-based authentication for Upstash
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `REDIS_URL="https://welcome-termite-32071.upstash.io"`
  - `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN="AX1HAAIncDFkMTJiYTJhZDBjZDA0MmU1OTY0NTZjNjgyMWRlM2Q3ZHAxMzIwNzE"`

### Cost Optimization
- **Auto-sleep enabled**: Machines stop when inactive (saves ~$5-10/month)
- **Minimal memory**: 256MB allocation sufficient for both projects
- **Efficient health checks**: 30-second intervals reduce overhead

### WebSocket Support
- **Automatic handling**: No special configuration needed in fly.toml
- **Works with auto-sleep**: Machines wake up on connection requests

## Current Status
- **Deployment**: Completed but health check failing
- **Issue**: App appears to be stopped, need to investigate startup errors
- **Next Step**: Debug health check failure and ensure proper startup

## Next Steps
- [ ] Investigate health check failure logs
- [ ] Verify Redis connection in production
- [ ] Test WebSocket functionality after successful startup
- [ ] Confirm auto-sleep behavior works correctly
- [ ] Document final configuration for future reference
