## Overview
Successfully completed the full migration from Nuxt 2 to Nuxt 3, including converting all components to Vue 3 Composition API, enabling TypeScript support, and replacing deprecated dependencies.

## Changes Made

### 1. Framework Upgrade
- Upgraded from Nuxt 2.18.1 to Nuxt 3.18.1
- Migrated from Vue 2.7.16 to Vue 3.5.18
- Replaced Webpack 4 with Vite build system
- Enabled full TypeScript support

### 2. Component Migration
- Converted all 8 Vue components from Options API to Composition API with `<script setup>`
- Fixed duplicate `</script>` tag issues in multiple components
- Updated all component imports and exports for Vue 3 compatibility

### 3. State Management
- Maintained Pinia stores (already migrated from Vuex)
- Created TypeScript index file for stores
- Removed JavaScript store files in favor of TypeScript versions

### 4. Dependencies Update
- Replaced `bootstrap-vue` with `bootstrap-vue-next` for Vue 3 compatibility
- Updated `@vue/test-utils` to latest version
- Installed `bootstrap` CSS separately
- Removed `@nuxt/bridge` and related dependencies

### 5. Plugin Updates
- Updated `socket.client.js` to use `defineNuxtPlugin`
- Created new `bootstrap-vue.client.js` plugin
- Removed deprecated `pinia.js` plugin (handled by @pinia/nuxt module)
- Removed conflicting server plugins

### 6. Configuration Changes
- Converted `nuxt.config.js` to `nuxt.config.ts` with Nuxt 3 format
- Removed old Nuxt 2 configuration file
- Updated package.json scripts for Nuxt 3 commands

## Technical Details

### Key Discoveries
1. **Package naming confusion**: Initially installed "nuxt3" package which was experimental nightly builds, correct package is "nuxt"
2. **Vue version conflicts**: bootstrap-vue was pulling in Vue 2, requiring migration to bootstrap-vue-next
3. **TypeScript support**: Nuxt 3 with Vite provides native TypeScript support without additional configuration
4. **Build system**: Successfully migrated from Webpack 4 to Vite, resolving previous ES2022 syntax issues

### Build Results
- Client build: ✓ 280 modules transformed
- Server build: ✓ 134 modules transformed  
- Total size: 4.08 MB (1.15 MB gzip)
- Build time: ~3.2 seconds

### Migration Statistics
- 28 files changed
- 13,291 insertions(+)
- 24,038 deletions(-)
- Net reduction of ~10,747 lines (cleaner, more modern code)

## Next Steps
- [ ] Test Socket.IO integration with the new Nuxt 3 server
- [ ] Create proper Nitro server plugin for Socket.IO
- [ ] Update Docker configuration for Nuxt 3
- [ ] Run full test suite and fix any failing tests
- [ ] Update deployment configuration for production
- [ ] Consider migrating to Nuxt UI or another Vue 3 native UI library

## Issues Resolved
- ✅ Nuxt 2 was still running instead of Nuxt 3
- ✅ TypeScript files not being recognized
- ✅ Vue 2/3 version conflicts
- ✅ Build errors with vite:vue plugin
- ✅ Module resolution errors for stores
- ✅ Duplicate closing script tags in components
